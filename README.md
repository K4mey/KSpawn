# KSpawn

This is an extremely simple plugin but very useful plugin for teleporting new players to the spawn, useful for hubs or small survival servers, which do not intend to install too many multi-purpose plugins.

All you have to do is to install the plugin and when you join the game set a spawn point and now anytime you join the server you will be teleported at spawn.

Commands:

    /setjoinspawn - Sets the spawning location
    /spawn - Teleports you to spawn

Permissions:

    /setjoinspawn - spawnonjoin.admin
    /spawn - spawnonjoin.command
